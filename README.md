# React Flux Todo listener

### Description

This is my attempt at making a todo list in Flux with react. It is a simpler version of [this tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/todo-list.html) from the Flux website.

### Dependencies

1. node >5
2. npm ~3.10.1

### Getting Started

I made this project by starting with boilerplate generated from [react-create-app](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/07/22/create-apps-with-no-configuration.html). If you haven't taken a look at it, I would reccommend it. It has most of the configuration you would need to set up a simple application in node and react.

To get started, first install all of the dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Then start the dev server:
```
npm start
```

It will hot-load any changes you make to the src folder. That's all there is to it.
